I am [MilesWK](https://github.com/MilesWK), the creator of ReplitConnections. ReplitConnections is a community-driven project to reconnect users of Replit after the removal of its community features.

This website serves as a repository for active users, projects, and resources related to Replit. I found it important to create a centralized space for Replit enthusiasts to collaborate and share ideas.

If you find any errors or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
